Data Set: https://archive.org/download/stackexchange 

- This project processes and analyzes the public data set available
  on archive.org of the posts made on Law Stack Exchange. The 
  data is organized to find the most frequent tags and frequencies
  of words utilizing the post_parser_record.py program, then uses
  this data in tandem with the NLTK package to tokenize words and
  remove stop words.

- Three graphs are made to analyze this data, including two word
  clouds, one analyzing the most frequent words, and another analyzing
  the most frequent tokens. The third graph compares the frequencies
  of the words in the data set to the projected frequencies based on
  Zipf's law.

- A PDF file analyzing the results of these graphs is also included
  in the project.
